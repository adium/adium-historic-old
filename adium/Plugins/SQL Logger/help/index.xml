  <title>Adium SQL Logging Instructions</title>
  <body>
    <p>SQL Logging implements Adium logging into a PostgreSQL database.<br />
      This offers several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Searching is very, very quick.</li>
      <li>Exceptionally detailed statistics.</li>
      <li>Very easy to view logs between certain time periods.</li>
      <li>Other goodness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To install this, a few things are required.
    Setup, however, is not that bad.
    At the base level, all that is required is PostgreSQL (duh).
    It can be installed from source, via fink, or by a package.</p>
  <p>I would recommend a package by Mark Liyanage.<br />
    You can find information and installation instructions at <a
      href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/postgresql/" class="offsite">http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/postgresql/</a>.</p>
    <p>There is also a set of installation instructions for installing
    PostgreSQL at <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/postgres.html" class="offsite">http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/postgres.html</a>.
    That tutorial is very good.  It covers installing PostgreSQL from source, shows
  how to use PostgreSQL with Perl (necessary for parser.pl or parser-2.pl to
  work), Java (necessary for the JSP viewers to work), and PHP (not necessary
  for this).  It also covers how to administer the database using phpPgAdmin, an
  administration program with a web interface.</p>
    <p>After you have PostgreSQL set up, create a user with your username.</p>
    <div class="tutorialcode">
      <pre>createuser <i>username</i></pre></div>
    <p>Then create a database with your username:</p>
    <div class="tutorialcode">
      <pre>createdb <i>username</i></pre></div>
    <p>After a database is created, you should be able to connect to it by
    simply typing <code>psql</code>.
    To log information, Adium will expect to have a certain setup in the
    database.  Get the following package: <a
      href="adium-sql.tar.gz">adium.tar.gz</a>.  After using Stuffit Expander or
    the command line to unpack it, there should these files inside:
    <ul>

    <p>The JSP files will allow you to view IMs with a web interface.  These
    can be used locally and from the world-wide web.</p>
    <p>The SQL files are a language that tells the database what type of
    information to store and tables to create.  They are split into two files: 
    the file called "adium.sql" will create the default table
    layout.  tsearch.sql will enable it to use a module called "tsearch",
    which allows for very, very fast searching.  It requires slightly more
    setup, which is why it has been split into a different file.</p>

    <p>To create the table needed for message logging, open a terminal window
    and switch to the directory that contains the files you just downloaded.
    (If you don't know how to do that, I would suggest <a
      href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/12/06/terminal_osx.html" class="offsite">this
      series of articles</a>).  Type <code>psql &lt; adium.sql</code>.  You
    should get messages like TABLE CREATED.  To ensure that it worked, type
    <code>psql</code>.  Then you will be connected to the database.  You
    should see something like this:</p>
    <div class="tutorialcode"><pre>Welcome to psql 7.3, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

jmelloy=#</pre></div>

  <p>To see the table you just created, you need to alter your search
  path.</p>
  <div class="tutorialcode">
    <pre>alter user <i>username</i> set search_path=adium,public;</pre></div>
  <p>After typing that, you should see the confirmation message <code>ALTER
      USER</code>. That changes only new instances of your user, so either
    quit psql (<code>\q</code>) and start again, or type <code>set search_path=adium,public;</code>.  After doing either of those, type "\d" and you should see something like this:</p>
  <div class="tutorialcode"><pre>jmelloy=# \d
                            List of relations
      Schema      |             Name             |   Type   |  Owner  
------------------+------------------------------+----------+---------
 adium            | messages                     | table    | jmelloy
 adium            | messages_message_id_seq      | sequence | jmelloy
 adium            | users                        | table    | jmelloy
 adium            | users_user_id_seq            | sequence | jmelloy
 adium            | message_v                    | view     | jmelloy
(5 rows)</pre></div>
  <p>The users table is very simple, a column for screenname, and an id.  The
  messages table stores all the messages themselves, and a reference to the
  users table.  Message_v contains a combination of both: the message, and the
  screenname who sent it, instead of a number.</p>
<p>At this point, you're ready to use the plugin.
  You can run <code>parser.pl</code> to insert all of your old logs into the
  database.  
  To run the script, a few modules are needed for your perl installation.
  The first one is called "DBI" (DataBase Interface) and the second "DBD-PG"
  (DataBase Driver-PostgreSQL).  Both can be gotten from fink or CPAN.
  The fink modules are called dbi-pm and dbd-pg-pm (in unstable).  More
  information on installation and use can be found in <a href="technical.html">Technical Details</a>.
  Run it by typing <code>./parser.pl</code>.  
  It should automatically find all of your logs, but you may need to edit the
  paths.
  As it stands, it will run over every screenname who logged into your computer.
  In future versions, it will be able to specify a specific user.
  </p>
  <p>Download the newest source of Adium
    2.0 from CVS, and compile it.  Instructions for downloading through
    anonymous CVS access can be found <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=67507"
      class="offsite">here</a>.  To compile, open "Adium.pbproj" and hit the
    "Build" button in the top left.
    Switch the target to "SQL Logger" (it should start at "Adium") and hit
  "Build".  Locate the built application, and control-click it.  Go to "Show
  Package Contents" navigate to the Plugin folder, and add "SQL
  Logger.AdiumPlugin" to it.  That should be all it takes to install it.
  </p>
  <p>You can also download a compiled plugin here: <a
      href="http://www.visualdistortion.org/adium/sql-logger.tar.gz" class="offsite">sql-logger.tar.gz</a>, uncompress it, and drop it
  in the Adium application as discussed above.  This will not work without
  PostgreSQL installed on your system, and the proper database setup.</p>

<p>Currently, the plugin doesn't have any prefs.  If your databae setup is
  non-standard, you need to set an environmental variable (PGHOST, PGUSER,
  etc) as described in the PostgreSQL docs.  If the plugin is installed correctly, it works very unobtrusively.  It
  never does anything unless there is a problem, so if you start it up and
  don't get an "Unable to Connect to Database" dialog, it's probably
  working.</p>

  <p>To check that either parser.pl worked correctly, and/or it's correctly
  logging, type <code>psql</code>.  To view messages:</p> 
  <div class="tutorialcode">
    <pre>select * from adium.message_v order by message_date desc limit 5;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>You should see the last five messages you sent/received.  To search for
  messages, you can do </p>
  <div class="tutorialcode">
    <pre>select * from adium.message_v where message ~ '<i>search string</i>';</pre>
  </div>
  <p>This interface is kind of a pain, and searching can
  be made faster.</p>
  <p>To make searching faster, it is best to install the <i>tsearch</i> module.
  To make the interface suck less, I've written a web-interface in JSP.  It
  uses a JSP engine (Resin or Tomcat).  I use Resin.  Instructions are in the
  sidebar on the left.
