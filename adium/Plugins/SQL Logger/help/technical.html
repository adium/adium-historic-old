<h3 style="background-color: #ccf">users</h3>
<p>The first table that is created is <code>users</code>.  It is very
    simple, storing only a username, a service, and a code, user_id.  Everyone
    who sends or receives a message will have an entry in
    <code>users</code>.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ccf">user_display_name</h3>
<p>The user_display_name table is quite simple.  It has a user_id field,
      which references <code>users.user_id</code>, a text field (display_name)
      and a date (effdate).  This table is used for storing Aliases and
      Display Names.  It stores them by date to get the most clear picture of
      someone whose display name/alias changes often.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say I'm talking to my friend Colin (user_id 100) on MSN.
      He has recently changed his MSN name to <i>Colin Rocks!  He's so cool!
        He's so good at everything!</i>
      When he IMs me at 6:15, a row is inserted into user_display_name with
      his name and the date (6:15).  We talk for a bit.
      Since this name is annoying, I set his alias to <i>Colin</i> at 6:30.
      Nothing changes in the database, since I haven't IMed him yet.
      At 6:45, I IM him.
      User_display_name now has a row with the following values:
      Colin / 6:45.</p>
<p>So now, doing a select on user_display_name, this is what I see:</p>
<div class="tutorialcode"><pre>select * from user_display_name where user_id = 100;
 user_id  | display_name  | effdate
 100      | Colin Rocks!  | 6:15
 100      | Colin         | 6:45</pre></div>
<h3 style="background-color: #ccf">user_statistics</h3>
<p>User statistics keeps a running total of messages sent and received.
      It stores a sender_id, a recipient_id, the total messages, and the date
      of the last
      message sent.  This table is primarily for speed, but not a lot does
      anything with it.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ff9">messages</h3>
<p>The second table, messages, contains the basis for the plugin: the
    messages.  Named <code>messages</code>, it has a sequenced field for each
    message (message_id), the message itself (message), the message date and
    time (message_date), and two references to users (sender_id,
    recipient_id).  If you have tsearch indexing setup, it contains another
    field (idxfti).</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ff9">message_notes</h3>
<p>Message notes can be used to add notes to yourself on a message.  It
      references a message_id, and contains a title, the note itself, and the
      date it was added.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ee5858">information_keys</h3>
<p>The SQL Logger has extensible meta-data, which means that you can
      choose to store any information  you want about a certain contact.  What
      you want to store (URL, Location, Website, Address, etc) are all stored
      in information_keys.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ee5858">contact_information</h3>
<p>The information about each contact is actually stored in
      contact_information.  It contains a field referencing information_keys,
      to determine which key is being stored, a user_id, a meta_id, and the
      value.  It can store something about either a user or a
      meta-contact.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #80ee80">meta_container</h3>
<p>meta_container stores the names of your meta-contacts.  It has a
      meta_id is the unique identifier for the meta-contact.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #80ee80">meta_contact</h3>
<p>meta_contact is very simple.  It contains only a meta_id and a user_id,
      so that as many users can be included in each meta contact as you want.
      It also contains a "preferred" contact, in the cases where one user is
      in multiple meta-contacts (so the viewer knows which to use).</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #c8c">saved_chats/saved_searches</h3>
<p>saved_chats and saved_searches exist so the viewer and search page can
      save their results.  They have copies of the same fields that the viewer
      and search pages have.</p>
<h3 style="background-color: #ccc">simple_message_v/message_v</h3>
<p>The created view is used for all of the message viewing.  It contains
      message_id, message, message_date, the screenames from users
      (sender_sn, sender_service, recipient_sn, recipient_service), and the
      display name at the time the message was sent.  It does
      not contain message_idx, the tsearch field, or any statistical
      information.  Using message_v can allow
      searches based on screenname instead of a (relatively) meaningless
      number.</p>
<h3>Insertions</h3>
<p>Both the Adium plugin and the log parsing scripts work by inserting a
      record into message_v.  When an insert is performed, a rule fires.  It
      attempts to insert the screennames into users, and doesn't if that
      screenname already exists.  Then it retrieves the two user_ids and
      inserts a record into message.  It also checks to see if the display
      name has changed, and if it does, inserts a new record into
      user_display_name.  Updates or deletes on message_v silently
      fail, and are best performed by operating directly on the underlying
      tables.</p>
