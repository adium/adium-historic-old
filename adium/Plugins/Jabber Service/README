This is the start of a plugin for the Jabber distributed IM protocol. Don't
expect too much. So far, it can only connect and disconnect.

It's based on the acid library used by the Nitro IM client. Acid can be found
at:

    CVSROOT:    :pserver:anonymous@jabberstudio.org:/home/cvs
    Module:     acid

The plugin expects that you have a compiled acid working copy at the same
filesystem level as the adium one.

Since it depends on an external library, it is disabled by default. You will
need to compile the target explicitly in ProjectBuilder and copy it to the
PlugIns directory of the built Adium application.
