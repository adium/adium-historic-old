/* IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * The rendezvous part of this library is implemented using the low-level Mach
 * port messaging to the mDNSResponser due to bugs in NSNetService. These bugs
 * include the inability to modify the TXT record of an advertised service, when
 * a service is no longer being published TXT records associated with the
 * service are not released and the inability to observe changes in the TXT
 * records of others.Until these bugs are fixed, we will continue to use the
 * Mach messaging interface to mDNSResponder (or another interface with similar
 * capabilities) instead of NSNetService/NSNetServiceBrowser
