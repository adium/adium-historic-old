Why does SEE use so much bandwidth?
Live updates. and if you are the one hosting it, well, you're bandwidth is screwed after like 5.
but. it's just... text!
Ya, it has to know where everyone is at all times. Like, look mah, I can highlight!

BUt ya, that could be improved.

TextAdium? :D

Lord if I know, maybe the protocol it uses just sucks.Kill. colins. connection. He is on 1:0 still. I think I am th
Someone else can hostie if they want :)
But... it's just text!  Compare to UT or WC3!!! :D  I can't host no more :) .. need bandwidth for cvs and other things

/********** SILLYNESS BEGIN
---------------------------------------
Stuff for Adam to do right this instant
---------------------------------------
- MAKE [Evan] A SAMMICH, WOMAN.
- Move user name field out of account code and into account list preferences code
- MAKE ME ANOTHER SANDWICH.
- This gets my vote.  I would love a sandwhich.
- Magically make display names work however the user intends, using notifications to change if they change their mind.  Note: Distributed notification center probably best for this task.
- Similarly, implement PSI-UI (Copyright The Adium Team) for all preferences, removing the preference window entirely.


- Evan, look into that assertion you put into the code that's crashing on new messages randomly :)
- I have to stop bitching and be productive? :P
- You can bitch while you're being productive !:D  *grumbles about preferences and starts at the account views*
- *boggles at evalU8rs*

but sillyness never ends. but endianness is often silly.

Bugs
----
* Account name not displaying correctly after service switch
* Create new account, tab from username->pass->account list.  Next tab should go back to username
* Stop contact list from auto-resizing under the dock
* Message tabs are not refreshing correctly when status changes
* Stray tab divider is displaying when dragging tabs
* When dragging a tab off quickly, it is possible for the tab bar to not finish moving to the correct position or to crash.
* Don't spawn new windows when we're hidden, doing so will unhide us
* Window content is drawing 2 pixels to the left when dragging tabs
* Prevent cmd-delete from working in the message window
* Mousekeys to move tabs causes a crash: http://www.visualdistortion.org/crash/view.jsp?crash=5930


# Give address book icons higher priority than server-side icons
	This is not a bug. It's desired behavior by a lot of people :P
	We probably need a default priority preference.
	We definitely need per-user preferences, including in-Adium setting of the icon.

Outstanding Issues (Important stuff to ponder)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nested groups are causing issues.  We need to think about keeping them around or not
 - They make re-ordering groups difficult
 - They have a very hard to fix bug with collapse/expand memory
 - Dragging empty groups makes them vanish
 - Other minor issues like draging groups into themselves
 - They limit contact list designs, some layouts won't work with nested groups
 - The group online/count totals are incorrect, difficult to calculate
















// Old Crap, clean up later ------------------------------------------
Contact List
- Remove text color preference.  All contacts will have a status color, and groups have their own color preference.
- Remove show contact labels preference
- Remove the contact count display preferences, these are in the view menu
- Remove preference for idle time color.  It should be the color of the text.
- Remove 'Idle & Away' status coloring.  There is no need for an additional color here.
- Remove the label colors for online, offline, idle, away
- Remove the text colors for signed on, signed off, typing, and unviewed content
Messages
- Add a message style preference (we will place inline and side prefix in separate views)
- Remove font, text, background preferences.  These should be set with cmd-T and remembered.
- Move show user icons to the view menu
Sounds
- Remove mute while away.  This will be included in the state system window.
Display Preferences:
- Remove outline group names with color.  This is a cute feature, but I've yet to see a place where it is used and actually looks good.
- Give background opacity a realistic lower value.  Anything below 75/80% is very difficult to read without misusing labels.
- Remove the option to disable shadows.  This should be an attribute of the transparent contact list, and not part of the standard one.
- Remove the option to specify label opacity.  This was needed for highly transparent contact lists, which will no longer be possible with the standard list, and should be removed.
- Remove the option to draw labels for groups.  Labels convey status changes.  Groups do not have status or status changes, and should not have labels.
- Remove the option to outline labels.  This should be an attribute of the transparent contact list, and not part of the standard one.
- Remove the option to only draw labels around the names.  When labels are used only for events this had little use.
Away Status Window
- Remove.  This functionality will be state specific and specified in the state window.
Tab Status Coloring
- Keep but hide.  Tabs will use the same text colors, label colors, and icons as the contact list.  This preference may be a necessity for users of dark themes.
Idle Message
- Remove.  This functionality will be state specific and specified in the state window.
Themes
- Remove or specialize.  We need themes because of how difficult it is to configure the contact list.  With the contact list much less difficult to configure the focus of themes should be reconsidered.  Either expand their scope, or narrow it.  If keeping:
opening incoming messages automatically?
make dock flap for a bit, and then stop and show unread messages
