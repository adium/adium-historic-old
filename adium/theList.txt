-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Create new account, tab from username->pass->account list.  Next tab should go back to username
* Don't spawn new windows when we're hidden, doing so will unhide us
* Window content is drawing 2 pixels to the left when dragging tabs
* Prevent cmd-delete from working in the message window
* Link tracking doesn't work if the link is the entire body of the first message received UNTIL you send a message, at which point it starts working

Minor Changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacts:
	+ Allow specifying an image for a contact in the inspector (Independent of address book)
	+ Add to buddy list menu item, contextual menu item (for strangers)
	+ Add area for typing contact notes to inspector, display notes in tooltip

Alerts:
	+ Allow user to have more control over what is spoken by the announcer plugin

	- Remove contact list font preference.  Hook this up to cmd-T
	- Remove the advanced option for vertical resizing, this is already covered in the main preferences.
	
Accounts:
	+ Allow user to cancel connecting of accounts
	- Remove account
	+ Auto-complete aliases and address book entries in New message prompt, log viewer

Menu Bar:
	
Message Window:

Contact List Display:
	+ Small contact list icon to idenfity mobile device users
	+ With offline contacts visible, hide the group counting 'visible' value.
	+ Change main auto-resizing preference to only toggle vertical resizing - this goes with the big contact list changes and should wait to see how they pan out.
	
Sounds:

iTunes Integration:

Other:
	# Add customizable hotkey to bring Adium to the foreground
		How is this possible? - we can set global hotkeys, no? - Is this necessary in Adium? Can't Key Xing or iKey can do it if you want it?.

	- Don't display libgaim errors for disconnect


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big Stuff
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Steps:
	- Remove submenus from accounts in the File menu
	- Make selecting an account in the menu connect / disconnect
	- Remove auto-connect checkbox from account preferences
	- Add global 'Restore previously connected accounts on launch' checkbox to account preferences

Sounds
	- Remove mute while away.  This will be included in the state system window.

Contact list display:
	+ Four components to the contact list:
	 	+ User Name - (Text) Name / Alias
	 	+ User Icon - (Image) AIM Buddy Icon / MSN Avatar / Address book icon
	 	+ Status Badge - (Image) Icon representing status, specified by user
	 	+ Extended Status - (Text) iChat status, away message, MSN state name, MSN user name/status
	+ User can toggle each component (Except user name) on/off with view menu items
	+ User can choose whether icons are on left or right.  Status Badge always goes on opposite side
	+ If icons are visible, extended status is displayed below user name, otherwise displayed next to user name


------From the old list:
Contact List
	- Remove text color preference.  All contacts will have a status color, and groups have their own color preference.
	- Remove show contact labels preference
	- Remove the contact count display preferences, these are in the view menu
	# Remove preference for idle time color.  It should be the color of the text.
	- Remove 'Idle & Away' status coloring.  There is no need for an additional color here.
	- Remove the label colors for online, offline, idle, away
	- Remove the text colors for signed on, signed off, typing, and unviewed content


Address Book Integration:
	+ We need a way for user specified icons in the address book to not be overridden/overwritten by adium when export is turned on. 

Emoticon Preferences:


Event Info (Implement as a new plugin, to replace bezel):
	+ Give the notification window a titlebar, and allow it to be repositioned while visible.  Evan: I disagree.  It should not have a 	titlebar.  Contact me for discussion :)
	+ Stack bezels when multiple events arrive eevyl note: hell not make this, queue them, with the posibility to dismish the more recent 	one with a widget to see next (or close the thing if it is the last one)
	+ Color the entire bezel to match the event being displayed
	+ Make the bezel smaller, clearer, easier to read, prettier
	+ Give the event info few preferences if any.
	- Don't use the Event Info to notify of new message notifications, use other plugin, different layout and all window clickable (like 	iChat)

Status images:
	- Remove status icons plugin
	+ Add images based status badges to the contact list
	+ Allow user to select icon sets (packaged in a bundle) in preferences


Contact Blocking:
	+ Add block and unblock menu items which prompt for the service and name
	+ Add block / unblock contextual menu items
	+ Add "Show Blocked Contacts" menu item to view, blocked contact list group
	+ Add "Block contacts not on my list" to AIM account preferences.
	- Ignore AIM's "Allow these" and "Block all" modes (for now, atleast)
	Evan: libgaim does not yet have support for accessing the privacy settings... we can add/remove from the list, but we have no way of knowing what's on it.


Multi-user chat: <<<INCOMPLETE>>>
	+ Show a users list
	+ Show status in users list
	+ Ability to invite
	+ If available, ability to remove a user

From the old list: Messages
	- Add a message style preference (we will place inline and side prefix in separate views)
	- Remove font, text, background preferences.  These should be set with cmd-T and remembered.

	+ Make default template, should be fast and nice.
	+ Background coloring

New State System: <<<INCOMPLETE>>>
	+ Events should have "flags", so that we could have a "message" event, which also has a "first message" flag, so that plugins can listen for "message" events using only one notification registration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfixable(?) Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Stop contact list from auto-resizing under the dock
	Evan: this is a tough area.  It does not auto-resize under the dock EXCEPT for at the edges, by design, since many people use a dock which does not extend to the edges of the screen and would like the contact list to reach down there.  So far as I can tell there's no way to know how wide the dock is; only how tall it is.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waiting On
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Interact with libgaim via a thread to avoid beachballing (Wait for Scott's patch - libgaim 0.76!, should fix)
