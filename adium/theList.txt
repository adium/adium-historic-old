Bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Don't spawn new windows when we're hidden, doing so will unhide us
* Libgaim disconnect errors are being displayed, and not ignored (since they are handled internally)
* Preference window crashes if you have a color picker open, close the window, and then click inside the picker.  The colorwell just needs to be told activate:NO in viewWillClose.  Fixing this requires verifying that viewWillClose is being called on advanced preference panes.
* In certain fonts, the tails of letters will stain in the text entry field after it clears.  This is visible with HoeflerText(size 12) - type a few j's and then press esc to clear the field.
* Pushing escape clears the text field, instead of allowing you to convert from kanji to romain. This can be considered a bug, but some people like the escape key to be used to clear the text field too, so maybe this could be a preference or something.

Other:
	+ Create a plugin to hide the AIM "Your screen name is now signed in 2 locations" messages
	# Rename all the classes in AIUtilities to have the prefix "AI" so that the framework is uniform.  This framework is designed to be Adium-independent, so we should make it easier to use in this way.

Big Stuff
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact alerts:
	Improve the contact alerts interface, reducing all editing to one window that is easier to use.
	(Model: http://homepage.mac.com/adamiser/sortathis6.png)

	Steps:
	- Remove alerts preference pane
	- Remove contact menu from alert window
	- Remove event popup from alert window
	- Disallow editing of events
	- Remove event view insertion (on selection)
	- Rework context menus.. change to "Edit Alerts"
	+ Add icons (16x16) to event types, and display them in the event list
	+ Add toolbar to window, add, edit, delete
	+ Add sheet for 'add', 'edit'.  Must be independent from alert window.
	+ Sheet has event, action, and contact (submenued by group) popups.

	+ Add "Contact Alerts" menu item to window menu for opening alert window
	+ Auto-fill sheet for new alert based on selection in window on clicking add


Contact list display:
	Add user icon and extended status display support to the contact list, and simplify its
	configuration to a small subset of nice looking cell arrangements.

	Details:
	+ Four components to the contact list:
	 	+ User Name - (Text) Name / Alias
	 	+ User Icon - (Image) AIM Buddy Icon / MSN Avatar / Address book icon
	 	+ Status Badge - (Image) Icon representing status, specified by user
	 	+ Extended Status - (Text) iChat status, away message, MSN state name, MSN user name/status
	+ User can toggle each component (except user name) on/off with view menu items
	+ User can choose whether icons are on left or right.  Status Badge always goes on opposite side
	+ If icons are visible, extended status is displayed below user name, otherwise displayed next to user name

Status badges:
	- Remove status icons plugin
	+ Add images based status badges to the contact list
	+ Allow user to select icon sets (packaged in a bundle) in preferences
    

Event Info (Implement as a new plugin, to replace bezel):
    	Notify the user of status changes for specific contacts with a small, very visible, easy to position, non intrusive
    	floating 'bezel'

    	Details:
	+ Give the notification window a titlebar, and allow it to be repositioned while visible.
	+ Stack bezels when multiple events arrive
	+ Color the entire bezel to match the event being displayed
	+ Make the bezel smaller, clearer, easier to read, prettier
	+ Give the event info few preferences if any.


Contact Blocking:
    	Allow the user to easily block/unblock users by name, or users on their list.  Provide a way for them to see
    	all blocked names and add/remove from the list.  Ignore the AIM specific block 'modes'.

    	Steps:
	+ Add block and unblock menu items which prompt for the service and name
	+ Add block / unblock contextual menu items
	+ Add "Block contacts not on my list" to AIM account preferences


Contact Inspector:
    	Provide a contact inspector with a lot of room to grow, that is easy to use, organized, and lets the user
    	manage all their contact specific settigns in one place

    	Steps:
    	+ Convert inspector to preference-like window with a toolbar of categories
    	+ Update existing inspector views to use big controls, and place them in the inspector categories
    	+ Move contact info into a category in the inspector


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Areas that require more thought before implementing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New State System:
    Allow users to create 'states' that describe their activity online.  States would set their status
    across the various protocols and allow them to alert certain behavior in Adium (Window spawning, 
    sounds, alerts, notifications, etc).  The goal is to replace the protocol specific state systems
    (idle & away) with something that better suits a user connected to multiple protocols, and allow
    Adium's behavior to be better customized to a user's diverse 'states' of IM throughout the day.

Multi-user chat:
    Powerful multi-user chat that can handle both large, moderated rooms (irc) and multi-way IMs (MSN).
    
Contact status coloring:
    Status coloring that is easy to configure and consistant throughout Adium.

Meta Contacts:
    Provide a way for users to create and manage their own meta contacts.    

Protocol Specific Functions:
    Provide a menu for service code to insert protocol specific options.  Things such as buddy search and
    password changing.

File Transfer:
    Non-intrusive prompts, download management, drag & drop transfer, previewing, direct connect,
    progress feedback, etc.
	
Event integration:
    Shift control of sound playing and dock bouncing to the event controller, keeping the existing preferences
    as a front to hidden events in the event system.  To reduce duplicate code and provide better behavior
    for custom sound and bounce settings that would otherwise conflict.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfixable(?) Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Stop contact list from auto-resizing under the dock
	It does not auto-resize under the dock EXCEPT for at the edges, by design, since many people use a dock which does not extend to the edges of the screen and would like the contact list to reach down there.  So far as I can tell there's no way to know how wide the dock is; only how tall it is.

* Don't overwrite user specified icons in the address book.  Only overwrite iChat placed icons (and store ours such that iChat will overwrite them) - (Evan: I spent an hour going through private frameworks trying to figure this out.  If you have any ideas, please let me know.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waiting On
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Interact with libgaim via a thread to avoid beachballing (Wait for Scott's patch - libgaim 0.76!, should fix)
+ Ability to view all currently blocked users  (Libgaim does not yet have support for accessing the privacy settings)
