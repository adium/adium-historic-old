Bugs
----
* If the first recieved message is a link, it is not clickable until you send another message or get sent one (I think)
= Account name not displaying correctly after service switch
* Create new account, tab from username->pass->account list.  Next tab should go back to username
* Stop contact list from auto-resizing under the dock - this is a tough area.  It does not auto-resize under the dock EXCEPT for at the edges, by design, since many people use a dock which does not extend to the edges of the screen and would like the contact list to reach down there.  So far as I can tell there's no way to know how wide the dock is; only how tall it is.
* Message tabs are not refreshing correctly when status changes
* Stray tab divider is displaying when dragging tabs
* When dragging a tab off quickly, it is possible for the tab bar to not finish moving to the correct position or to crash.
* Don't spawn new windows when we're hidden, doing so will unhide us
* Window content is drawing 2 pixels to the left when dragging tabs
* Prevent cmd-delete from working in the message window
* Mousekeys to move tabs causes a crash: http://www.visualdistortion.org/crash/view.jsp?crash=5930
* Contact list display format preference not applying correctly on launch
* Link tracking doesn't work if the link is the entire body of the first message received UNTIL you send a message, at which point it starts working

Minor Changes
-------------

Contacts:
	+ Allow specifying an image for a contact in the inspector (Independent of address book) - this should go with the inspector/Get Info merger...
	= Add Offline status coloring
	= Remove sorting preferences.  Consolidate these and place them in the view menu - (Evan: MINOR CHANGE?! I'm hurt.)
	+ Add to buddy list menu item, contextual menu item (for strangers)
	+ Add area for typing contact notes to inspector, display notes in tooltip

Alerts:
	+ Allow user to have more control over what is spoken by the announcer plugin

Preferences: 
	- Remove contact list font preference.  Hook this up to cmd-T
	+ Move idle time display preference to view menu

	= Move user name field out of account code and into account list preferences code
	+ Display 'New Account' in account list for accounts without a UID
	+ Allow user to cancel connecting of accounts
	+ Auto-complete aliases and address book entries in New message prompt, log viewer

Menu Bar:
	+/= Add dividers to view menu - The current solution is imperfect; it would be better to define new menu locations in the menu controller.
	= Change window cycling menu items to 'Previous Chat' 'Next Chat'
	
Message Window:
	+ Insert/Edit link menu item, accompanying link entry panel, edit link context menu
	+ Tab scrubbing.  If control is held when mousing over a tab, select that tab
	+ Open new windows behind the frontmost window (When not opening in tabs)
	+ Insert emoticon menu item, contextual menu item

	- Remove "per-contact" window position/size saving. Instead, use the size/position of the last window, and cascade new ones
	
Contact List Display:
	+ Small contact list icon to idenfity mobile device users
	+ With offline contacts visible, hide the group counting 'visible' value.
	+ Change main auto-resizing preference to only toggle vertical resizing - this goes with the big contact list changes and should wait to see how they pan out.

Other:
	+ Add customizable hotkey to bring Adium to the foreground
		How is this possible? - we can set global hotkeys, no? - Is this necessary in Adium? Can't Key Xing or iKey can do it if you want it?.
	+ Create a plugin to hide the AIM "Your screen name is now signed in 2 locations" messages
	- Don't display libgaim errors for disconnect

	- Remove show contact labels preference
	- Remove the contact count display preferences, these are in the view menu

Emoticon Preferences:
	= Remove +/- buttons
	= Make source list display all available emoticon packs
	= Add checkboxes in source list to enable/disable packs


Event Info (Implement as a new plugin, to replace bezel):
	+ Give the notification window a titlebar, and allow it to be repositioned while visible.  Evan: I disagree.  It should not have a 	titlebar.  Contact me for discussion :)
	+ Stack bezels when multiple events arrive eevyl note: hell not make this, queue them, with the posibility to dismish the more recent 	one with a widget to see next (or close the thing if it is the last one)
	+ Color the entire bezel to match the event being displayed
	+ Make the bezel smaller, clearer, easier to read, prettier
	+ Give the event info few preferences if any.
	- Don't use the Event Info to notify of new message notifications, use other plugin, different layout and all window clickable (like 	iChat)

	- Ignore AIM's "Allow these" and "Block all" modes (for now, atleast)

	+ Background coloring
	+ Emoticons

New State System: <<<INCOMPLETE>>>

------------------------
  Controversial stuff
-----------------------

Message Sending:
	# Make option-sending a message send the message to every tab in the current message window.
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
			This may be better implemented in mass messaging from contextual clicking a group in the contact list, or some other implementation of mass messaging.
		( Comments )
			Evan: This should be done via "/all" or something instead of option-send... that's too close to "insert a line break" for my tastes.
		
	# Mass messaging
		( Pros )
			Easily convey messages to a group
			It's cool.
			Great for people who work in an office.
		( Cons )
			Possible spam
		( Comments )
			Tick: This does give the ability for people to be spammed, but I think the good would outweigh the evil in this feature.

Contact List Display:
	#Nested groups are causing issues.  We need to think about keeping them around or not
		( Pros )
			Nested groups open up the potential of expanding meta contacts
			Nested groups are good for organization
			They're fun
			Would be good for mass messaging
		( Cons )
			They make re-ordering groups difficult
			They have a very hard to fix bug with collapse/expand memory
			Dragging empty groups makes them vanish
			Other minor issues like draging groups into themselves
			They limit contact list designs, some layouts won't work with nested groups
			The group online/count totals are incorrect, difficult to calculate
			Groups have strange names in other clients
			They can't sort into a "by Status" sorted list very well - have to have an option to sort to the top or the bottom

 
 
	# Extend labels to the full width of the list
		( Pros )
			Easier to work with in code
		( Cons )
			Could make the contact list look larger than it is.	
		
	# Remove the rounded caps <<< PILLOWS!!!
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
		
Address Book Integration:
	# Give address book icons higher priority than server-side icons 
		( Pros )
			This is not a bug. It's desired behavior by a lot of people.
		( Cons )
		
		( Comments)
			Tick: I personally don't see where this is not desired behavior if you have ab integration turned on.
		

Emoticon Preferences:
	#Show a warning icon when 2 icons would overlap. This would be when you have 2 or more packs. State which would be used visually.
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
		( Commets )
	
Message Window:
	# Preference to disable sending of typing notifications
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
	# Animate Buddy Icons once when clicked
		( Pros )
			Makes the animated icon people happy
			Makes the people who don't like animated icons happy
			Makes everyone happy :D
		( Cons )
			Probably harder to code than to just display the icon
			Animated icons are about as annoying as <marquee> and <blink> html tags to some people
		( Comments )
			I'm not sure we're getting animated files from libgaim at present.		
			Tick: Can we stop showing the icon or disable animation like gaim does?
			
	# Tab creation preference: Last created window, new window, group by group, group by account
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
Multi User Chat
	# Ability to hide users list
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
Account / Connect panel
	# A check box or something to easily connect an account
		( Pros )
		
		( Cons )
		
		( Comments )
			Hanji: I find gaim's use of a checkbox to connect/disconnect an account extremely unintuitive, I would vote against that.
			Evan: I'm with Hanji.

Meta Contacts:
	User Defined Meta Contacts:
		# Specify a the order of contacts, for status updates on the contact list
			( Pros )
				This is expected behavior
			( Cons )

Stuff we have to wait on

// Old Crap, clean up later ------------------------------------------
----------------

Display Preferences:
- Remove outline group names with color.  This is a cute feature, but I've yet to see a place where it is used and actually looks good.
- Give background opacity a realistic lower value.  Anything below 75/80% is very difficult to read without misusing labels.
- Remove the option to disable shadows.  This should be an attribute of the transparent contact list, and not part of the standard one.
- Remove the option to specify label opacity.  This was needed for highly transparent contact lists, which will no longer be possible with the standard list, and should be removed.
- Remove the option to draw labels for groups.  Labels convey status changes.  Groups do not have status or status changes, and should not have labels.
- Remove the option to outline labels.  This should be an attribute of the transparent contact list, and not part of the standard one.
- Remove the option to only draw labels around the names.  When labels are used only for events this had little use.
Away Status Window
- Remove.  This functionality will be state specific and specified in the state window.
Tab Status Coloring
- Keep but hide.  Tabs will use the same text colors, label colors, and icons as the contact list.  This preference may be a necessity for users of dark themes.
Idle Message
- Remove.  This functionality will be state specific and specified in the state window.
Themes
- Remove or specialize.  We need themes because of how difficult it is to configure the contact list.  With the contact list much less difficult to configure the focus of themes should be reconsidered.  Either expand their scope, or narrow it.  If keeping:
opening incoming messages automatically?
make dock flap for a bit, and then stop and show unread messages
