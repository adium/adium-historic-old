//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Minor Changes
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacts:
	= Add area for typing contact notes to inspector, display notes in tooltip [Brian] 
            // core functionality is done, now I'm adding AB syncing, and possibly AIM Buddy Note sycing
	+ Context menus
		* Do we need to show the "Add Contact..." item, greyed out, on basically all contacts?
			[Dave] Is there an easy way to hide it when not needed? I don't know of one with our system
		* Do we sure "Delete" should be in the context menu? How often is this used?
Alerts:
	+ Allow user to have more control over what is spoken by the announcer plugin
	+ Display time stamps in the panel alert
	+ Support the %escapes in alert text (such as %n to speak the contact's name)

Contact List: 
    + Add toolbar item for setting status (goes with the state system?)
	+ Add Action menu toolbar item, ala Xcode or Mail.
	- Remove contact list font preference.  Hook this up to cmd-T
	- Remove the advanced option for vertical resizing, since this is already covered in the main preferences.
	* Renaming doesn't work at the moment.
	
Accounts:
	+ Auto-complete aliases in log viewer
	+ Add 'Priority' field to jabber advanced preferences

Message Window:
	+ Need a way to allow tabs to be rearranged (within the same tab bar) even when dragging between windows isn't permitted (i.e. when group-based sorting is enabled), and vice-versa.
		Currently, tabs can be dragged to new windows but not rearranged when name-based sorting is on, but dragging is right out when group-based sorting is on.
	+ Open new windows behind the frontmost window (When not opening in tabs) [Colin]
        I don't know quite what to do here. I'd like some guideance. <<< I never got any guidence, dammit! :P <<< Still lacking guidence here. We need to have a group chat about this...
	= Insert emoticon menu item, contextual menu item [Brian]
            // this can now be deemed done... although it should now be Insert Emoticon button/menu ala iChat/MSN/AIM in message view
	+ Tab-complete usernames in messages and chat
	+ Make 'save as' menu item work
	+ Accept dragged items and do wonderful things on them, like if it is text append it in the input field or if it is a file send it to the contact.
        * Push/pop indicator could use 1-2 px extra spacing from the right & left since its nearly flush with the scrollbar 
	+ Put a delay on typing events... time out when typing stops.
	
Contact List Display:
	+ Small contact list icon to identify mobile device users

Other:
	+ Create a plugin to hide the AIM "Your screen name is now signed in 2 locations" messages
	+ '--insensitive' flag in AIEmoticon (to be placed in the TextEquivalents.txt file) that allows emoticons' text equivalents to be case-insensitive (without applying this nature globally to all emoticons).
		Colin: Didn't Mac-arena do this already?
	+ "New message..." dialog should search for all contacts, and then after that offer the protocols from where you can talk to the buddy found. The way it works now seems a bit rare, as you have to select the protocol first, and maybe you just don't remember or something and you type the name (address book for example) of your buddy just to see it doesn't work.
	+ Add preferences to disable 'Fast User Switching' auto-away, and to customize the message. [Colin]
	+ Create a plugin to parse sed expressions, similar to the tex plugin.
	+ Add export option to log viewer
	+ Fetch yahoo profiles from http://profiles.yahoo.com/[BUDDYNAME] for the info window (libgaim doesn't do this for us?)
	+ Jabber links, support xmpp:user@host/resource or xmpp:user@host  
	+ Don't spawn new windows when we're hidden, instead queue them and open the windows next time we're unhidden
	+ Symlink the iChat emoticons much like we symlink the iChat sounds

Contact alerts:
	+ Add icons (16x16) to event types, and display them in the event list (still needed on some.  make the ESContactAlert subclasses respond to -icon)
	+ Menu has "all contacts in ___" items, and "all contacts" item (?)
	
Dock contextual menu:
	+ Make the menu controller capable of handling putting dock menu items in certain categories, or something; at present
		it is only possible to add it to the dock, resulting in a really disorderly menu.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Big Stuff
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toolbar Items:
    Contact List:
        + Away Messages
        + Add Group
        + Add Contact
        + Delete Selection
        + Show offline contacts
    Message Window:
        + Show Logs
        + Show Font Panel
        + Show Color Panel
        + Send File
        + User Icon
        + Emoticon
        + Add Link
        + Bookmarks
        + Scripts

Contact list display:
	Add user icon and extended status display support to the contact list, and simplify its
	configuration to a small subset of nice looking cell arrangements.

	Details:
	+ Four components to the contact list:
	 	+ User Name - (Text) Name / Alias
	 	+ User Icon - (Image) AIM Buddy Icon / MSN Avatar / Address book icon
	 	+ Status Badge - (Image) Icon representing status, specified by user
	 	+ Extended Status - (Text) iChat status, away message, MSN state name, MSN user name/status
	+ User can toggle each component (except user name) on/off with view menu items
	+ User can choose whether icons are on left or right.  Status Badge always goes on opposite side
	+ If icons are visible, extended status is displayed below user name, otherwise displayed next to user name
	+ Add option to not display groups on the contact list (Be careful with this and manual ordering)

Status badges:
	- Remove status icons plugin
	+ Add images based status badges to the contact list
	+ Allow user to select icon sets (packaged in a bundle) in preferences

Event Notifications (the feature formerly known as Event Bezel):
    + Give the contact alert a nice icon.
    + Give the notification window a close widget to quick-dismish the event, if it is the last one close the thing entirely. Maybe if clicking it with option hold down should close all queued events altogether.
    + Give the notification window a mail dock icon like badge to show the total number of recent events to be shown on it
    + Add small pretty protocol icons (we need nice icons for this)
    # Add status icons (the desired thing should be to use the same ones as the ones in the forthcoming new contact list)
	# Give the notification window a titlebar, and allow it to be repositioned while visible.
      not sure about adding a titlebar to it [Jorge]

[Colin]
Contact Blocking:
    	Allow the user to easily block/unblock users by name, or users on their list.  Provide a way for them to see
    	all blocked names and add/remove from the list.  Ignore the AIM specific block 'modes'.

    	Steps:
	+ Add block and unblock menu items which prompt for the service and name
	+ Add block / unblock contextual menu items
	+ Add "Block contacts not on my list" to AIM account preferences

Documentation
	Documentation is considered one of the most important parts of a project. It is also the most tedious part. We need good documentation in order to assist users and developers. These should include screen shots if possible (visual aid). Documentation should not be moved to the done portion of this list until every other part is done, as things may change.

	+ User documentation
		
	+ Developer Documentation
		+ We already have some documentation. This needs to be gone through
		+ Creating webkit themes
		+ Address book integration

Activity Window
Will sort of resemble Safari's. Entries in the window only reflect progress of items; actions are performed from the toolbar.
= Done! [boredzo]
		
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Areas that require more thought before implementing
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New State System:
    Allow users to create 'states' that describe their activity online.  States would set their status
    across the various protocols and allow them to alert certain behavior in Adium (Window spawning, 
    sounds, alerts, notifications, etc).  The goal is to replace the protocol specific state systems
    (idle & away) with something that better suits a user connected to multiple protocols, and allow
    Adium's behavior to be better customized to a user's diverse 'states' of IM throughout the day.

[Dave]
Multi-user chat:
    Powerful multi-user chat that can handle both large, moderated rooms (irc) and multi-way IMs (MSN).
		- Tick: would we want a drawer or a list, or a collapsable list or what? Everyone seems opposed to a drawer, so a list would do better.
		- Dave: I'm going to start making this work, but I NEED LOTS OF HELP!!
	Thoughts:
		- Dave: We need a tiered status system. Example: in IRC, "dchoby98 was granted ops by ChanServ"
		  is a status message. In one-on-one chat, "dchoby98 went away: <message>" is a status
		  message. These need to have different "classes" so that we can pay attention to, or ignore,
		  an entire class of messages.
		
Contact status coloring:
    Status coloring that is easy to configure and consistent throughout Adium.

Meta Contacts:
    Provide a way for users to create and manage their own meta contacts.    

Protocol Specific Functions:
    Provide a menu for service code to insert protocol specific options.  Things such as buddy search,
    password changing, getting info on non-listed users, etc.

File Transfer:
    Non-intrusive prompts, download management, drag & drop transfer, previewing, direct connect,
    progress feedback, etc.

Event integration:
    Shift control of sound playing and dock bouncing to the event controller, keeping the existing preferences
    as a front to hidden events in the event system.  To reduce duplicate code and provide better behavior
    for custom sound and bounce settings that would otherwise conflict.

Deferring of initial message:
   Don't pop up a message window if one doesn't already exist.  Use some kind of dock indicator / list indicator.  Double click on list or dock menu item would display the message.  If a window is already open, new messages would create a tab as normal.  We could associate this option with the state system for some pretty cool behavior.

Contact List import/export:
   Import/export code is not fun. 

Sorting:  Allow a 'minor' sort option like iChat?  (iChat uses the last selected as the subsort).  Not sure if this would be useful.

Too many tabs issue:
	It seems that if you have too many tabs, then the tabs come to a point of not being usable. Tabs rock, but with 15 open windows intrinsic issues with this approach start to appear. We could:

	1) Offer a side list/drawer as an option.
	2) Have the arrows thing like in gaim and other clients.
	3) Multiple rows of tabs

	This will require a great deal of thought probably, and may not be resolvable for all parties.
        
Link Management:
    Just throwing out a thought for discussion... how about a button like those for emoticons or push/pop with add/edit and a list of favorites to make them accessible within the message view without using contextual menus? In that same vein... what about autocompleting recognized URLs (such as www.ad completes to www.adiumx.com if its a favorite)? 
	//Steve: yeah, both of those seem to be good ideas, and the link editor window is certainly abstract enough to be called through most any mechanism, and I had always intended a button to be included for it eventually.  Auto-completing URLs is an interesting idea... and would work very well if done right.  I'd comment more, but I'm feeling a little under the weather right now. :\
    
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Unfixable(?) Issues
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Stop contact list from auto-resizing under the dock
	It does not auto-resize under the dock EXCEPT for at the edges, by design, since many people use a dock which does not extend to the edges of the screen and would like the contact list to reach down there.  So far as I can tell there's no way to know how
 wide the dock is; only how tall it is.

* Don't overwrite user specified icons in the address book.  Only overwrite iChat placed icons (and store ours such that iChat will overwrite them) 
	- (Evan: I spent an hour going through private frameworks trying to figure this out.  If you have any ideas, please let me know.)
	- (Tick: Maybe we can use steganography, crysflame in irc brought it up, and eevyl and I have discussed it before:
			19:45 < crysflame> http://www.mirrors.wiretapped.net/security/steganography/outguess/outguess-0.2.tar.gz and 
http://www.mirrors.wiretapped.net/security/steganography/stegdetect/stegdetect-0.5.tar.gz

* Fix the Output Device Control plugin so it doesn't crash on Jaguar (unfixable?) Alternatively, figure out a way to have it be on by default in Panther, but off in Jaguar.

* WebKit caching is meaning that buddy icons don't update until Adium restarts. 

* If you uncheck the "play user interface feedback sounds" in System preferences, and disable the "Use Custom Volume" checkbox in Adium, no sounds are played
