// Bugs - Adium
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Short emoticons mask longer ones
	For instance, :) prevents :)) from working.  A solution to this would be shorting
	all the text equivelants from longest to shortest, but the way we store emoticons
	makes this impossible.

- Escapes aren't processed in links
	The escapes are filtered using the plain text version of the message, so any
	escapes within the link attributes of the attributed message are not filtered.
	This prevents subprofile links from working.

- Applescripts are parsed in other's profiles
	This is a potential security risk if the user has scripts that run shell commands.
	We should not be parsing script commands sent by other users (via profiles)

- Spawning new windows unhides Adium
	We don't want to spawn new windows while Adium is hidden.  Windows should be qued
	and shown when Adium is unhid.

- Contact list view goes behind toolbar
	It's possible for the contact list view to become stuck under the toolbar,
	covering the first few contacts on the list.  Toggling the toolbar will sometimes
	correct the view.

- Adding contact with no groups crashes
	Adding a contact with no groups defined crashes adium.

- Adding contact that already exists
	Adding an existing contact causes issues.  It may result in duplicate contacts on
	the user's list, and will make the contact appear offline.  Sometimes they will
	appear on the list twice until Adium is restarted.

- Auto-reconnect too aggressive
	If an AIM account fails to connect due to signing on and off too quickly, Adium
	will continue to try and reconnect, displaying the error message over and over
	and trying its best to get that name blocked for as long as possible.

// Bugs - LibGaim
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ICQ] Displaying raw HTML (Messages sent from iChat)
	Libgaim is escaping all incoming HTML characters over ICQ.
	
- [ICQ] Encoding problems
	Encoding, specifically in Hebrew, is not being received properly.  Sending
	appears to work fine.

- [MSN] Outoing chat appears twice
	Libgaim is sending our message back to us

- [Yahoo! Japan] Encoding problems
	Japanese isn't being sent properly.  I would guess this limits the usefulness
	of the protocol ;)
	
- [ALL] File transfer limitations
	File transfers often fails to navigate firewalls and routers

- Webkit styles rendering incorrectly in very wide windows
	The two included styles with problems are Smooth Operator and Mockie

- Webkit styles are inconsistently handling long lines
	All styles should use the overflow scrollbar if possible.  The following styles
	do not: Elisha, Minimal, Mockie, Retro, Simple

- Webkit styles must support multi-line status messages
	The included style with problems is Smooth Operator 

- Bottom alignment issues
	The simple message style has a bottom alignment issue.  Send a few messages, but
	not enough to make the scrollbar visible, then type a two line message into the
	entry field.  The message view will incorrectly render extra bottom margin.


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Deferred (Awaiting a rewrite / other change)
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Info window can be opened with no selection
	Shows a blank window titled "window".  Waiting on info/inspector/alert merge.

- AIM chats are logging as (null)
	Happens with both loggers.  Waiting on full multi-chat support.

- Interface feedback must be on for sounds
	If you uncheck the "play user interface feedback sounds" in System preferences,
	and disable the "Use Custom Volume" checkbox in Adium, no sounds are played.
	Waiting for core-audio sound rewrite.


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Unconfirmed
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- User icons are still getting flipped (Icons from AIM, apparently)
- We have issues with preventing the user from sending messages when they might
	actually be able to send (invisible AIM users, after we get disconnected?)
- If one tries to change one's idle time to a lower amount, (for example, from 2:32
	to :36), an update will not occur, and your idle time will stay at 2:32.
- Unicode (German) messages not working over ICQ ?
- away messages aren't going away (if we disconnect, then they come back, then we
	re-connect?)
- Yahoo ignore list is being ignored?
- Apple scripts can stall Adium when iTunes 4.5's Print dialogue is open
- Changing timezone doesn't update time stamps immediately (I'm not surprised, but
	this would be cool)
- Messages with invalid looking HTML <tags> received via jabber (from ICQ user over
	transport), the invalid tags are being eaten? (Our HTML decoder isn't eating them, is libgaim?) 
- We aren't fetching the display names of ICQ users, some icq users, when over AIM?
	(They still show up in the info, apparently)
- Dragging buddies on MSN account not working
- AIM Passwords with question marks in them prevent libgaim from connecting?
- Out of curiosity - is there a reason we use .adiumEmoticonset instead of
	.adiumEmoticonSet (call me a capitalization nut :)?
