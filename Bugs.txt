// Adium X Known Issues
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HIGH]
Meta Contacts
  - MetaContact ordering does not always restore properly

[MEDIUM]
    - Plugins always prompt to disable.  I realize this is Adam's preferred
      behavior, but some people actually use plugins :)

Contact List
    - Extended Status to the right of names is misaligned with baseline.
Logs
    - View Logs searches for screename instead of using the newer filtering style.
    - Logging happens in case (i.e. AdIuM instead of adium), just not 1st line or 2.

[LOW]
  - Adding contact that already exists
    Adding an existing contact causes issues.  It may result in duplicate contacts on
    the user's list, and will make the contact appear offline.  Sometimes they will
    appear on the list twice until Adium is restarted.
  - Tooltips are not appearing for links in profile text.
  - Tooltip alignment fails in long away messages and other large blocks of text.
  - Double clicking two names in succession causes the first name to highlight
    the second time.
  - An incoming message which opens a new tab will also unminimize the associated window
  - Error message window doesn't wrap & resize properly for long titles (Gaim often
	sends messages with longer titles than we expect)

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Libgaim
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (AIM / Jabber) File transfers often fail to navigate firewalls and routers
- (Yahoo) Files over 1 MB in size fail to send
- (Jabber) Authorization problems
- (AIM) Contacts can get incorrectly tagged as being on an AOL Mobile Device
- (AIM) Group Chat : Japanese (and probably other charsets) doesn't get sent properly,
	but can be received - only with certain default languages. English default language
	works fine for these charactersets... so the default C encoding must be being used
	(incorrectly) somewhere in libgaim?
- (ICQ) Broken ICQ clients send HTML. Should we try to correct for this?
- (All) Gaim's proxy support is unreliable at best


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Unconfirmed
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Pasted content with line breaks may fail to send via Rendezvous
- Yahoo ignore list is being ignored?
- Messages with invalid looking HTML <tags> received via jabber (from ICQ user over
    transport), the invalid tags are being eaten? (Our HTML decoder isn't
    eating them, is libgaim?)
- We aren't fetching the display names of some ICQ users when over AIM?
    (They still show up in the info, apparently)
- Adium will remain invisible to 2nd party after a Jabber authorization confirmation (from xtapo on IRC)
    "Well, I hit grant to his auth request, and he still won't be able to see
    me." -- xtapo
    previously authorized contacts work as expected.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Unavoidable
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AppleScripts stall Adium when iTunes 4.5's Print dialogue is open (the same bug exists in Script Editor)

    [Chris] - We could use a seperate app/daemon that is polling itunes.
    blacktree.com has something for that, and GrowlTunes could also be made to
    do what is needed, if we are going to just look for current playing track.
