//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Adium X 0.70 remaining issues
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HIGH]
Messages & Chat
  - Initial messages from invisible contacts sometimes don't open new message windows
  - Chat windows can re-open when contact status changed (If using cmd-n to change source
    account)
  - Intermittent crash when closing a group chat, particularly via MSN

Meta Contacts
  - To/From bar in messages can get into a weird infinite loop when multiple possible source
	and target accounts/contacts exist on the same serviceClass
  - Source account is not always accurate when a contact within a metaContact is messaged
  - MetaContact ordering does not always restore properly
  - Away message is output multiple times when an open chat's contact goes away
	and that contact is within a metaContact
  - Own autoresponse is sometimes sent on the wrong chat when a contact within a metaContact
	sends a message
  - Unchecking the address book consolidate contacts option has no effect [Evan]

[MEDIUM]

[LOW]
  - Autoaway after Idle is broken
  - Adding contact that already exists
    Adding an existing contact causes issues.  It may result in duplicate contacts on
    the user's list, and will make the contact appear offline.  Sometimes they will
    appear on the list twice until Adium is restarted.
  - Tooltips are not appearing for links in profile text.
  - Tooltip alignment fails in long away messages and other large blocks of text.
  - Double clicking two names in succession causes the first name to highlight
    the second time.
  - An incoming message which opens a new tab will also unminimize the associated window

// Bugs - Libgaim
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (AIM / Jabber) File transfers often fail to navigate firewalls and routers
- (Yahoo) Files over 1 MB in size fail to send
- (Jaber) Authorization problems
- (AIM) Contacts can get incorrectly tagged as being on an AOL Mobile Device
- (AIM) Group Chat : Japanese (and probably other charsets) doesn't get sent properly, 
	but can be received - only with certain default languages. English default language
	works fine for these charactersets... so the default C encoding must be being used
	(incorrectly) somewhere in libgaim?
- (All) Gaim's proxy support is unreliable at best


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Unconfirmed
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Inserting a command which runs an AppleScript which opens a dialog box causes the next
    messages to appear to be from the wrong person (reported by reikonmusha on AIM)
    (Example: have someone else send you messages, then use
    http://mywebpage.netscape.com/EterNal%20x%20OI%20x/AiTC_2_2.zip and
    call the /help script, then send more messages of your own)
- We have issues with preventing the user from sending messages when they might
    actually be able to send (invisible AIM users, after we get disconnected?)
- If one tries to change one's idle time to a lower amount, (for example, from 2:32
    to :36), an update will not occur, and your idle time will stay at 2:32.
- Yahoo ignore list is being ignored?
- Messages with invalid looking HTML <tags> received via jabber (from ICQ user over
    transport), the invalid tags are being eaten? (Our HTML decoder isn't
    eating them, is libgaim?)
- We aren't fetching the display names of some ICQ users when over AIM?
    (They still show up in the info, apparently)
- AIM Passwords with question marks in them prevent libgaim from connecting?
- Adium will remain invisible to 2nd party after a Jabber authorization confirmation (from xtapo on IRC)
    "Well, I hit grant to his auth request, and he still won't be able to see
    me." -- xtapo
    previously authorized contacts work as expected.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bugs - Unavoidable
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Apple scripts stall Adium when iTunes 4.5's Print dialogue is open (the same bug exists in Script Editor)

    [Chris] - We could use a seperate app/daemon that is polling itunes.
    blacktree.com has something for that, and GrowlTunes could also be made to
    do what is needed, if we are going to just look for current playing track.
