<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL requires some routine maintenance to function properly.
      As PostgreSQL makes an update, it does not actually delete the old
      version of the record.  It does this because if multiple processes are
      accessing the database at the same time, a single process has no way of
      knowing if any other process is looking at the same record its modified.
      Therefore, any process/transaction that started looking at the table
      before the record was modified see the old version, even if the record
      has already been changed.</p>
<p>This problem is very simple to solve.  All that needs to be run is
      PostgreSQL's <code>VACUUM</code> command.  This flags all old tuples to
      be overwritten the next time they need to be.  It's meant to be run in
      an update/delete heavy application, and the adium stuff isn't very
      update/delete heavy under normal use, but it's still a good idea to run
      it periodically.  (Once a week or so.)</p>
<p>Running vacuum can be accomplished a few ways:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Through psql:<div class="tutorialcode"><pre>vacuum;
vacuum analyze;</pre></div>
</li>
      <li>Through the command line:<div class="tutorialcode"><pre>vacuumdb
vacuumdb -z</pre></div>
</li>
    </ul>
<p>These can easily be added to a weekly cron job or automatic maintenance
      script.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>If you are not getting the kind of performance you want from
      PostgreSQL, a few things might be at blame.  PostgreSQL makes use of
      indexes to perform faster lookups on tables.  These indexes are very
      similar to indexes in a book, and serve the same purpose.  PostgreSQL is
      very smart (sometimes too smart) about when not to use indexes.  If your
      table isn't big enough, it won't take advantage of them at all.</p>
<p>If you want to see if PostgreSQL is using an index for something, you
      can construct a similar query in psql:</p>
<div class="tutorialcode">
      <pre>select * from im.message_v where message_date &gt; 'now'::date;</pre>
    </div>
<p>That query should return very quickly.
      If you want to see exactly how fast it runs:
    </p>
<div class="tutorialcode">
      <pre>explain analyze select * from messages where message_date &gt; CURRENT_DATE;</pre>
</div>
<p>The output I get is something like this, for a relatively typical
      day:</p>
<div class="tutorialcode">
      <pre><b>Index Scan</b> using adium_msg_date_sender_recipient on messages (cost=0.00..160.60 <b>rows=45</b> width=97) (actual time=0.11..3.55 <b>rows=223</b> loops=1)
  Index Cond: (message_date &gt; '2003-09-02 00:00:00'::timestamp without time zone)
  Total runtime: <b>4.31 msec</b>
 (3 rows)</pre>
</div>
<p>I've swapped <b>message_v</b> for <b>messages</b> here, because message_v
   has a nasty query plan, and it's very difficult to learn anything
   constructive from it.</p>
<p>The important parts of the example above are boldfaced.
   I've boldfaced the term &quot;Index Scan&quot;, because that indicates it is using
   the index (named adium_msg_date_sender_recipient) to determine where the
   proper dates are.  This is good.  Index Scans are much faster than
   Sequential Scans for large tables.</p>
<p>If you're not seeing an index scan, there are a few reasons that could be
   the cause:
   <ul>
     <li>Not enough data
       <ul>
         <li>if your table is small, there is no reason to use
           an index scan
         </li>
       </ul>
     </li>
       <li>Not properly analyzed.</li>
       <ul>
         <li>If the number of rows in the cost and the number of rows in the
           result are significantly different (a factor of 10 or so), rerun
           <code>vacuum analyze</code> and try again
         </li>
       </ul>
   </ul>
