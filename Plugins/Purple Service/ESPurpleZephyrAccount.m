 * @brief Return the gaim status ID to be used for a status
 *
 * Most subclasses should override this method; these generic values may be appropriate for others.
 *
 * Active services provided nonlocalized status names.  An AIStatus is passed to this method along with a pointer
 * to the status message.  This method should handle any status whose statusNname this service set as well as any statusName
 * defined in  AIStatusController.h (which will correspond to the services handled by Adium by default).
 * It should also handle a status name not specified in either of these places with a sane default, most likely by loooking at
 * [statusState statusType] for a general idea of the status's type.
 *
 * @param statusState The status for which to find the gaim status ID
 * @param arguments Prpl-specific arguments which will be passed with the state. Message is handled automatically.
 *
 * @result The gaim status ID
