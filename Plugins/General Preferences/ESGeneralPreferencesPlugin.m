/* 
 General Preferences. Currently responsible for:
	- Logging enable/disable
	- Message sending key (enter, return)
	- Message tabs (create in tabs, organize tabs by group, sort tabs)
	- Tab switching keys
	- Sound:
		- Output device (System default vs. system alert)
		- Volume
	- Status icon packs
 
 In the past, these various items were with specific plugins.  While this provides a nice level of abstraction,
 it also makes it much more difficult to ensure a consistent look/feel to the preferences.
