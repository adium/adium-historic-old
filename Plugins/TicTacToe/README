----Adium TicTacToe Plugin----

This is an Adium 2.0 plugin to play Tic Tac Toe over Adium.
It sends moves and status via instant messages. To use it, install
the plugin either to [Adium]/Content/Plugins, or to 
~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Plugins, and then restart Adium and
select Tic Tac Toe Board from the Window menu, and click New Game to invite 
someone to play. If they have the plugin installed, they will get prompted to 
accept or reject the invitation, otherwise the invitation will time out after
(currently) 10 seconds, and you will be notified that they do not have the plugin
installed.

----KNOWN ISSUES----
-The plugin currently only allows one instance of itself per Adium
	invocation, so you can only play one game at a time, and not with
	another account open from the same instance of Adium
-Error handling is weak
	Conditions such as remote client logoff, or a bad network that drops 
	messages are not handled well - If anything weird happens, just have both
	clients do a File|Reset Tic Tac Toe
	
(The following is mainly for my purposes, don't worry if it makes no sense)
----TODO-----									----Status----
Stop Window Raise on send			I'm starting to blame Adium for this one
Reason for rejection
Contextual Menu										DONE
