				<p>Adium's event notification system includes support for both audible and visual notifications which can selectively be applied globally, per group, or per contact.</p>

						<strong>To Create a Personalized Event Preset:</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>Choose <strong>Preferences</strong> from the <strong>Adium</strong> menu</li>
							<li>Click the <strong>Events</strong> button</li>
							<li>Click the <strong>Event preset</strong> drop-down menu</li>
							<li>Click <strong>Add New Preset...</strong> from the sub-menu</li>
							<li>Enter a title for your new preset and click <strong>OK</strong></li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>Now you can begin adding or removing events in order to achieve exactly right set for you. You can also start to explore the many different events that can trigger a notification and the various responses that Adium can supply.</p>
		<p>This system of event presets is very powerful for users who need to: occasionally IM in silence but would still like to receive Growl notices, or not be distracted by any notification but still be online; or any other situation you can think of. Now you can create as many presets as you need!</p>
		<p>Also, remember that in addition to global events you can also apply per group and per contact events. To setup per group events make sure you have groups visible (choose <strong>Show Groups</strong> from the View menu) then control click (or right click) on the group you would like to setup up events for and choose <strong>Get Info</strong> and then click the <strong>Events</strong> tab. Setting up per contact events works exactly like per group events except you control click a buddy's name and choose <strong>Get Info</strong>.</p>
