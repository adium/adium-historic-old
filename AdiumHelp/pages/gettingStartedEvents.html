				<h1>Configuring Event Notifications</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Adium's event notification system includes support for both audible and visual notifications which can selectively be applied globally, per group, or per contact.</p>
		<p>Audible notifications are provided by QuickTime.</p> 
		<p>Visual notifications are provided by <a class="ext-link" href="http://growl.info">Growl</a>. If Growl isn't installed the first time Adium attempts to post a Growl notification then you will be asked to install Growl; Adium includes a built-in installer for the latest Growl.</p>
		<p>The default event preset does not use any Growl notifications. However, Adium comes with a secondary event preset called "Visual Notifications" which will setup a basic set of Growl notices for the most common events. For more in depth information about creating a new event preset please refer to <a href="Advanced.Events.html">Creating a Personalized Event Preset</a>.
		<p>If Growl is not working, please visit our <a class="ext-link" href="http://forum.adiumx.com/">Support forums</a>.<br />
			The <a class="ext-link" href="http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?t=2619">Growl not doing anything with Adium</a> thread is a good place to start.</p>
			<p>For more information on Growl please visit the <a class="ext-link" href="http://growl.info">Growl website</a>.</p>
