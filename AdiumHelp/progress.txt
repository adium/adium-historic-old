We now have "how to setup"  and "how to register a new" pages for all services - although the latter are just placeholders; proper Help Book style linkage for the main page (now named AdiumHelp.html per Apple's standard naming); the beginning of the auto-generated "Solving Common Problems" page - although the topics being listed are not the proper ones, it's just to show how that works in case someone else wants to add to it; the "Index" page is just lifted from iChat for now - figured that was as good a place as any to use as a starting point. NOTE: all my new pages are in the pgs directory, eventually the pages directory will be completely removed.
