//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Possible Thoughts
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Status Menu
  Add a 'Status' menu between view and contact.  This menu would contain
	- Selectable user-defined states (Offline, available, at school, busy, afk, ...)
	- Account-specific connectivity & convenience (Moved from the file menu)
  These changes allow for removal of account and status related menu items
  from the file menu.

//Status Window
  The new state system should focus on ways for the user to
	- Quickly set a specific status (quick away, idle, dnd, available message, alias)
	- Define 'states' which apply status across services and alter adium behavior
  The new state system should be contained within its own window, continuing
  with the trend to move 'content' out of the preference window.

//Accounts Window
  Move account preferences to their own window
	- Move user-icon and alias into the 'personal' tab
	- Dim service icon slightly on selection (Similar to contact list)
	- Use status icon to show online state instead of postfixing 'online/offline'

//Message window toolbar
  Additional message window toolbar items
	- Open font/color panel (standard system buttons)

//Auto-completion
  Tab auto-completion in the message window
	- Contact names (Mainly for multi-user chat)

//File Receive Prompt
  The receive file prompt should be its own panel, and provide options for
	- Save (To desktop / download folder)
	- Save As... (Prompt for location)
	- Ignore
  This will solve issues with the save dialog catching keystrokes, and provides
  an easy way to just save an incoming file to the desktop.

//Fast User Switching
  The fast user switching plugin needs to provide advanced preferences for
	- Enabling or disabling the feature
	- Changing the status message used when switched
  [Steve: Must these go in the 'advanced' pane?  Can't we find a better home for them?
   Seems the 'status' pane makes sense - maybe a set up not unlike auto-idle? It serves a similar purpose.]

//Kill Plugins
  Refactoring is fun, refactoring is scary, refactoring could greatly simplify our code
	- Remove the menu controller, hook plugins directly to their menu items
	- Remove preference obfuscation, preferences in one nib, hooked directly to their code
	- Remove many unneeded plugin classes, interfaces, clutter
  Keeping the modular design, but ditching all the negative effects of it could be very beneficial
	
//Message Tabs
  - Enforce a larger minimum width for tabs
  - Use a chevron to display tabs that don't fit on the tab bar (like safari)
  - New close button graphic
	
//Sorting Improvements
  - Improve status sorting defaults
  - Simplify custom sort window by removing duplicate/redundant options
 
//Flashing reduction
  Make it possible to use Adium without any distracting flashing and blinking
  - Add option to remove flashing unviewed content on the contact list
  - Add option to prevent dock icon animations

//Formatted messages
  Some users like formatted and colored messages, other want messages to look
  the way they've decided in the preferences.  Let's make message formatting
  preferences follow this distinction
  - Preference "Send Formatted Messages", off by default.  When enabled, user
    can pick font, size, color of their messages.  This formatting is used
    when typing, displaying, and sending their message.
  - Preference "Display formatting of received messages", off by default.  When
    enabled, the font, size, and color of incoming messages will be displayed.
  By default we will completely ignore message formatting.  Users who want
  formatting will look for a way to set their font/color and find the options
  in general preferences.
  
//Plugin Version Control
  Simple solution to compatibility with 3rd party plugins
  - Every release of Adium has a plugin version number
  - When the interfaces change (only .x releases), this number will increment
  - Plugins have a version number in their info.plist
  - Adium will only load plugins if their plugin number matches Adium's
  This means that every major upgrade of Adium will require a new plugin download.
  Since releases are bigger and further apart, this will not be a major issue.

//Offline contacts
  Add group specific offline visibility toggles to the contact list.
  
//Deferring of initial messages
  In certain situations the user may not want new messages to automatically open
  windows.
  - Add an option to not open windows for incoming messages
  - Allow this option to be set/unset depending on our status (State system)
  - Display the number of new messages in the dock (Similar to mail)
  - Allow retrieval of these messages from the status/dock menu and contact list

//Contact list editing
  We need contact list editing to feel safe
  - Improve drag images
  - Improve drop targeting, especially when dragging contacts with sorting on
  - Prevent list from flickering states when editing (contacts appearing to sign on, off, etc)
  - Improve reliability of moving, deleting, and adding contacts
  - Improve error handling with full lists
  - Improve error handling when adding contacts that already exist

//Improved info window
  Update the info window appearance and profile display
  - Fix support for sub-profile links [Evan: These work for me.  Confirmation, anyone?]
  - Use WebKit to handle the HTML unless there is some overwhelming reason we parse it
    // this should resolve several issues and gives great benefits - like tooltips & copy link
  
//Preferences
  - Improve organization of advanced preferences (group several small panes into a general
		advanced pane, possibly on a per-category basis)
  - Add advanced categories for service specific preferences
  - Make heights of preference panes equal where possible
  - Fade between preference panes when switching?

//Alerts
  - Display time stamps in the panel alert
  - Support %escapes in spoken alert (such as %n to speak the contact's name)

//Saving and Exporting
  - Allow 'save as' from a message window to export the current conversation
  - Allow 'save as' from within the log viewer to export logs

//Logging
  - Per account account logging preferences would allow users to choose which accounts are
    logged instead of the all-or-none approach we have now.
           - Add tab in all accounts with [x] Log chats
           - We can move the logging format pref. to this as well.
           - Other requirement would be a flag in the logging code to check account & pref.
  - Support printing from Log Viewer and its toolbar (add item)

//First run
  - We need a more intuitive interface for a first-time user to get started with Adium.
    Possibilities are:
		- Simply a revamped Accounts window
		- A first-run Adium setup wizard [Evan: this is my inclination]
			* Basic account setup
			* Initial configuration of a few key preferences
  - The Migration Assistant, with expanded program support and a revamped UI, should 
    automatically offer its services when Adium is first launched, ‡ la Mail.app's
	importer.
        
// Address Book integration [brian - just marking it as mine if no one else beats me done]
    - Sync (optionally) contact notes to an associated AB card's Notes field
    - Ability to add a screenname into AB as a new card
    - Add People Picker & ability to add via this panel
  
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Incomplete Thoughts
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Message Preferences
	- Clean up variant submenus and other message preference aspects
        - Provide way to delete a message style from within Adium

//Privacy Preferences
  Allow the user to easily block/unblock users by name, or users on their list.  Provide a way for them to see
  all blocked names and add/remove from the list.  Ignore the AIM specific block 'modes'.
	- Add block and unblock menu items which prompt for the service and name
	- Add block / unblock contextual menu items
	- Add "Block contacts not on my list" to AIM account preferences
        
//Sound Preferences
	- Provide a way to manage (delete at minimum) soundsets

//Announcer Improvements
	- Allow user to have more control over what is spoken by the announcer plugin

//Service-Specific
	- Add 'priority' support for jabber connections
	- Service specific functions (buddy search, password changing, etc)

//Contact List
	- Easy identification of mobile users
	- Round label caps for events
	- Improve status hierarchy 
	- We need to either support contacts at the root level or not support them; we currently do a mixture
		which is very confusing to new users.  For example, a new Jabber account has no groups, but adding
		a contact with no groups has no visible effect.

//Alerts
  - Clarify wording, clean up alert panes

//Status on message window
  - Show our current status on the message window

//Documentation
	- User documentation

//Message context improvements
	- The message context system will not work well with deferred messages.

- Make command-= an alternate for Add Contact (command-shift-=, or command-+)
