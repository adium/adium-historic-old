We didn't want to touch Adium.framework precious so a lot of wheel re-invention has occurred.
Or at least we haven't used some of the lovely components that Adium provides :(
It's that pesky NSParameterAssert(_sharedAdium != nil); and whatnot ...

SMD is as independent of Adium as such a related program can be.

__Implemented__
* SMD loads the correct icon dependant on whether Adium is running or not.
* Offers a menu item to quit SMD.
* Change the menu items icon to the evil duck when there is unviewed content
* Menu option to quit Adium from the SMD
* There is a menu item to launch Adium (if it isn't running). It however doesn't necessarily run the right version of Adium should multiple versions exist ...
* Menu option to make Adium the frontmost app

__To Do__
* Load status menus - PARTIAL but doesn't work
-
* Load the correct icon for the users status (Plugin broadcasts status? Custom object vended via DO. Notification when contents of object change so that SMD knows to reload?!?)
* Load account menus
* Activate chats
* Connect/disconnect accounts

* Add SMD as a startup item

__Bugs__
* Localize all strings
* We should probably symlink or alias to the resources we "borrow" from Adium
* "Launch Adium" doesn't launch the right Adium.
