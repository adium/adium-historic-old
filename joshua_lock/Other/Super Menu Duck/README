We didn't want to touch Adium.framework precious so a lot of wheel re-invention has occurred.
Or at least we haven't used some of the lovely components that Adium provides :(
It's that pesky NSParameterAssert(_sharedAdium != nil); and whatnot ...

SMD is as independent of Adium as such a related program can be.

__Implemented__
* SMD loads the correct icon dependant on whether Adium is running or not.
* Offers a menu item to quit SMD.
* Change the menu items icon to the evil duck when there is unviewed content
* Menu option to quit Adium from the SMD
* There is a menu item to launch Adium (if it isn't running). It however doesn't necessarily run the right version of Adium should multiple versions exist ...
* Menu option to make Adium the frontmost app
* SMD now supports three different *states* (Adium online / Adium running / Adium not running) and draws menus accordingly as opposed to the previous two states (Adium running / Adium not running)

__To Do__
* Load status menus - PARTIAL: the status items load but have no images and no attached action
-
* Load account menus
* Load the correct icon for the users status (Plugin broadcasts status? Custom object vended via DO. Notification when contents of object change so that SMD knows to reload?!?)
* Activate chats
* Connect/disconnect accounts

* Add SMD as a startup item

__Bugs__
* Localize all strings
* We should probably symlink or alias to the resources we "borrow" from Adium
* "Launch Adium" doesn't launch the right Adium.
* Status menu items have no images. I think we need to convert the NSImage into something more suitable for sending down a DO pipe then convert back at the other end
* If we convert status into a cString we get Super Menu Duck[6590] Conversion to encoding 30 failed for string "â™« iTunes"
* REGRESSION: Status set for *all* accounts
* We are re-instantiating the DO connection from the SMD each time as I can't work out what's going wrong. This is bad but will be fixed
