To set up the build environment (fetch the source trees):
python download.py `cat urls.txt`

Also get a copy of the pidgin sources:
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/UsingPidginMonotone

When you set up your pidgin working copy, set the environment variable
PIDGIN_SOURCE to be the path to your WC. current_step.sh needs this to work.
In bash/zsh: export PIDGIN_SOURCE="/path/to/im.pidgin.pidgin"
In csh/tcsh: setenv PIDGIN_SOURCE "/path/to/im.pidgin.pidgin"

Then, once you have the source trees, the current build process is this:
./dep_make.sh
./purple_make.sh
# this next step will die soon, it's here because of the churn on the procedure
# for building libpurple
./current_step.sh
./universalize.sh

which will leave you with frameworks in build/Frameworks.
