Adium interface and user experience improvements
------------------------------------------------

Use an auto-extracting disk image
- Nobody wants to read our readme or boring license
- Users have trouble installing from the dmg window because (depending on their setup) it’s tricky to get the application folder open and ready for a drop since the window won’t spawn a new window when you click its icon.


Add a setup assistant
- Throwing new users into our preferences is bad
- We need a chance to explain to users that they need an account on a service in order to use that service, a setup assistant is the perfect place for this.
- Giving novice users some basic options and doing a bit of self advertising (see iChat’s assistant) is also a good idea.


Remove auto-connect
- Auto-connect is clashing with out state memory system
- Auto-connect is completely replaced by state memory


<<under discussion>>

Clarify the account checkboxes
- It is not intuitive what they do.  If you think they are, then why do users always ask us what they’re for? Yeah, i think they are... but good point.


Remove tab sorting
- Nobody uses this, and it doesn't even work right

Pluginize sound output device control.
- Move sound volume control into said plug-in as well

Pluginize opacity, maximum width, horizontal resizing, and contact list window style controls 
- Or do something clever with these to remove their preferences :)

Move message view custom background, font controls to a customize sheet
- The font control confuses novice users
- These controls are used by a minority of users

Pluginize the floating away status window

Pluginize the fast user switch state change preference
	- Default to setting the user as generic away, not away with a message?  The message was the main problem for lots of users I think.  I think changing their status at all is a bit annoying..  I can see if somebody might want it though, but honestly I could care less and would rather stay as I left it.
It's a lot less annoying than changing to offline.  Agreed.


Add a simplified events interface
- The current one is too complicated.  Have menus for sounds, popup notifications, dock bouncing, etc.  Each should have a pretty icon, a checkbox/menu to enable it, and a customize or advanced button providing more control for advanced users.

Clean up the advanced events interface
- There is no need for it to be an outline view, have multiple columns, or have variable height rows.
- Showing empty actions complicated and clutters the interface.  Having the plus button pop up a menu is a more consistent interface.

Rename the chat menu items in file
- Join New chat is misleading because you can use it to create a chat
- New chat is misleading because it's creating a new message, not a chat

Update new message window
- The new message window is not HIG compliant

Update new chat window
- The new/join chat window is not HIG compliant and looks like AOLIM eew.

Remove the auto-updating script system
- It's slow, it crashes, it's annoying and it's unnecessary if we have good AS support and interface with third party applications.

Clarify wording of contact name formatting menu item

Move account specific actions out of the status menus

Update file transfer window
- The bottom bar is not HIG compliant (too skinny)

Update add contact window
- This window is a little confusing and needs more padding and pictures

Update add group window
- This window is not HIG compliant

Improve emoticons customize
- Simplify and clean up the interface
- Make it clear when there are service specific emoticons and allow configuration of them.
	- Perhaps a 'service' column in the table view.

Remove dock icons show all sheet
- We do not need this clutter
	[Evan: but it's so pretty!]

Add group specific view controls to the contact list

Simplify the alert edit sheet
- The header is not necessary and not HIG compliant

Improve contact list appearance
- Remove the toolbar, add a footer, add our icon and make it pretty

Improve message window tab appearance
- Round the corners and shade them softer

Improve info window appearance
- Make it HIG compliant, right now it looks like AIM and is oh so useless
- Make it use Bindings - in fact, this is probably the first place where we should use them

Fix AppleScript
- Many things are non-working in non-obvious ways: The dictionary says it should work, and yet it doesn't.

Better bookmarks importer
- Use a floating panel instead of a menu, thereby sidestepping all NSMenu borkenness.
- Only load the bookmarks on resume when the panel is open; also load them when the panel is opened initially.
- Could use an outline view; example:
	▾ Safari
		Adium X			http://www.adiumx.com/
		Adium CIA		http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/adium
	▸ OmniWeb
	▾ Camino
		Growl			http://growl.info
		Growl CIA		http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/growl
- Double-clicking on a browser would activate it (and open its bookmarks, if possible); double-clicking on a bookmark would insert it as a link, as would clicking on an 'Insert' button in the panel.
