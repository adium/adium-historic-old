#pragma mark Service Description
//Unique identifier for this class
//The serviceCodeUniqueID identifies this class.  No two classes should have the same uniqueID.  This value is used
//to determine which protocol code to use for the user's accounts.
//Examples: "libgaim-aim", "aim-toc2", "imservices-aim-.mac"

//Service class
//Some separate services can communicate with eachother.  These services, while they have separate serviceID's,
//are all part of a common service class.  For instance, AIM, ICQ, and .Mac are all part of the "AIM" service class.
//For many services, the serviceClass will be identical to the serviceID.
//Service classes may change, do not use them for any permenant storage (logs, preferences, etc)
//Examples: "aim-compatible", "jabber", "msn", "icq"

//Human readable, long description of this service
//If there are multiple classes available for the same service, this description should briefly show the difference
